My name is Steph Prince. I am a PhD candidate in Neuroscience, and I study the neural activity underlying memory and how these memory processes are disrupted in Alzheimer's disease.


My long-term goal is to take my favorite parts of grad school (thinking about interesting questions, applying novel analyses, discovering answers in the data), and transition this experience into a career in data science. I'm starting this website as a personal compilation of side projects to learn some new skills.


Here we go!
