Summary: Introduction to the goals and vision for my website

#### Hello World. I'm starting the new year with my first website.

Like many people, I've found the best way to learn new things is in the context of a project. Also like many people, I've found it can be difficult to get started on new side projects, especially when I feel as if I should be constantly working on my thesis research.

I thought this website would be a motivating way to build up a portfolio of side projects and to have a record of all of the cool things I can accomplish. Before I get started, I want to outline my personal goals:

  * learn to work in Python (Most of my experience is in Matlab)
  * try out new analyses and approaches to working with data
  * develop a compilation of side projects on topics *very outside of my research*

If you've somehow found this page, thanks for reading! You can follow along with my trials and tribulations as I go. I'll leave you with a little bit about myself:

#### if you don't know me...

I'm currently a graduate student in Atlanta, where I get to study neuroscience and drink iced coffee all year long. Check out the [About](https://stephprince.github.io/pages/about.html) page for more details.

#### if you're wondering what a neuroscientist does...

See what the amazing people in my lab and I are doing on the [Research](https://stephprince.github.io/pages/research.html) page.

#### if you're like I was about 24 hours ago and don't know how to setup a website...

*here are some tutorials to make it happen:*

[This Fedora blog post](https://fedoramagazine.org/make-github-pages-blog-with-pelican/) is the one I actually followed step by step before I found the resources below. Caveat: I had to reset my output folder to a submodule after using this tutorial, since you're not supposed to have a git repo inside of another repo.

[Emory Graduate Data Science](https://data-science-for-scientists-atl.github.io/quick-and-easy-data-science-websites-with-pelican-and-github-pages.html) (an organization I'm on the executive board for) has a very detailed tutorial on how they built their website.

[Cyrille Rossant](https://cyrille.rossant.net/pelican-github/) has a different approach that I found after I set the website up already. I'll try applying the automated website builds he uses sometime in the future.

[Christine Doig](https://chdoig.github.io/create-pelican-blog.html) has a lot of great background and answers several terminology questions that came up while I was building the website. She also explains how to customize your theme once you've set it up.

*and here are some themes to make it look good:*

[Pelican Bootstrap](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/pelican-bootstrap3) *yeti* is the theme I decided to use. I tried the two below first because I liked their style, but they had less documentation and support so I found them more challenging to adapt in a way that suited me. Check out their examples file for some great inspiration.

[Medius](https://github.com/onur/medius) is a theme I found that I really liked the style of, but I ultimately decided against because it came with less built-in options.
